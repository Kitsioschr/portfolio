### Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches

#### Project Description
> "Time to begin applying your statistical testing skills to historical data of men’s and women’s international soccer matches! You’ll work at a major online sports media company specializing in soccer analysis and reporting. You will test the hypothesis to determine of women’s international soccer matches result in more goals scored than men’s"
>
> The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Perform an appropriate hypothesis to determine the p-value and determine the answer to the question: “Are more goals scored in women’s international football matches than men’s?”

Assume a 10% significance level and use the following null and alternative hypothesis:
- H<sub>0</sub> : The mean number of goals scored in women’s international matches is the same as men’s
- H<sub>A</sub> : The mean number of goals scored in women’s international matches is greater than men’s

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/69f20afc-2d48-4f7b-b250-d0ca51f4f461/edit).

### Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles

#### Project Description
> "Los Angeles, California, attracts people from all over the world, offering lots of opportunities, not always of the good kind! In this project, you’ll serve as a data detective, supporting the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in analyzing crime  data to guide how they should allocate resources to protect the people of the city!"

> The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Explore the dataset and
- find which hour has the highest frequency of crimes,
- find which area has the highest frequency of night crimes,
- identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups.

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/2cbc17d2-5dc2-4cb7-b428-7685cb886114/edit).

### Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners

#### Project Description
> "The Nobel Prize is awarded yearly to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace, with the first prize awarded in 1901. Are there any biases in the way the honors are awarded? Use your data manipulation and visuaization skills to explore the history of this coveted prize."
>
> The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
- Find the most commonly awarded gender and birth country.
- Find the decade with the highest ratio of US-born Nobel prize winners to total winners in all categories.
- Find which decade and Nobel prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates.
- Find who was the first female Nobel prize winner and in which category.
- Find which individuals or organizations have received more than one Nobel prize throughout the years.

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/e93708e4-ba85-46d5-af18-b89287975215/edit).

### Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

#### Project Description
> "Each year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students. In this project you will use standardize test performance data from NYC's public schools to identigy the schools with top mathematics results, look at how performance varies by borough and find the NYC's top ten performing school."
> 
> The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Answer the following questions:
- Which NYC schools have the best mathematics results?
- What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
- Which single NYC borough has the largest standard deviation?

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/456b9869-cb71-409e-b50a-cb2f27fba081/edit).
