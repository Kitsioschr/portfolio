## Projects Description

### Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

#### Project Description
> "Delve into the information about penguins by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques on a thoughtfully curated dataset. Uncover concealed patterns, clusters, and relationships that exists within the dataset."

The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Apply unsupervised learning (k-means clustering) to cluster Antarctic penguin species based on the following features:
- culmen length,
- culmen depth,
- flipper length,
- body mass,
- sex.

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/ed2e6e97-873a-4a35-8445-5ece17cbcd9b/edit).

### Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

#### Project Description
> "A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure one out of the four essential soil measures:
> - *Nitrogen* content ration in the soil,
> - *Phosphorous* content ration in the soil,
> - *Potassium* content ration in the soil,
> - *pH* value of the soil.
>   
> The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important feature that could help predict the crop accurately. Can you help him?"

The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Identify which feature of the following:
- Nitrogen content ration in the soil, 
- Phosphorous content ration in the soil, 
- Potassium content ration in the soil
- pH value of the soil
has the strongest predictive performance (F1-score) for classifying crop types.

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/84d81d7e-8245-4a3b-8aa9-fba4beac92a8/edit).

### Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

#### Project Description
> "You’ve been hired by a major online data science training provider to store their data much more efficiently, so they can create a model that predicts if course enrollees are looking for a job. You’ll convert data types, create ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling."

The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
You have been asked by the Head Data Scientist to create a DataFrame that stores the data in the csv file more efficiently. The requirements are as follows:
- columns containing categories with two factors must be stored as Booleans,
- columns containing integers must be stored as 32-bit integers,
- columns containing floats must be stored as 16-bit floats,
- columns containing nominal categories must be stored as the category data type,
- columns containing ordinal categories must be stored as ordered categories,
- the DataFrame must contain only students with 10 or more years of experience in companies of at least 1000 employees,
- there should be a substantial decrease in memory usage.

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/6e1665fd-3f09-444d-83f7-ed2d7d7449bb/edit).

### Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches

#### Project Description
> "Time to begin applying your statistical testing skills to historical data of men’s and women’s international soccer matches! You’ll work at a major online sports media company specializing in soccer analysis and reporting. You will test the hypothesis to determine of women’s international soccer matches result in more goals scored than men’s"

The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Perform an appropriate hypothesis to determine the p-value and determine the answer to the question: “Are more goals scored in women’s international football matches than men’s?”

Assume a 10% significance level and use the following null and alternative hypothesis:
- H<sub>0</sub> : The mean number of goals scored in women’s international matches is the same as men’s
- H<sub>A</sub> : The mean number of goals scored in women’s international matches is greater than men’s

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/69f20afc-2d48-4f7b-b250-d0ca51f4f461/edit).

### Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles

#### Project Description
> "Los Angeles, California, attracts people from all over the world, offering lots of opportunities, not always of the good kind! In this project, you’ll serve as a data detective, supporting the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in analyzing crime  data to guide how they should allocate resources to protect the people of the city!"

The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Explore the dataset and
- find which hour has the highest frequency of crimes,
- find which area has the highest frequency of night crimes,
- identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups.

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/2cbc17d2-5dc2-4cb7-b428-7685cb886114/edit).

### Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners

#### Project Description
> "The Nobel Prize is awarded yearly to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace, with the first prize awarded in 1901. Are there any biases in the way the honors are awarded? Use your data manipulation and visuaization skills to explore the history of this coveted prize."

The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
- Find the most commonly awarded gender and birth country.
- Find the decade with the highest ratio of US-born Nobel prize winners to total winners in all categories.
- Find which decade and Nobel prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates.
- Find who was the first female Nobel prize winner and in which category.
- Find which individuals or organizations have received more than one Nobel prize throughout the years.

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/e93708e4-ba85-46d5-af18-b89287975215/edit).

### Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

#### Project Description
> "Each year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students. In this project you will use standardize test performance data from NYC's public schools to identigy the schools with top mathematics results, look at how performance varies by borough and find the NYC's top ten performing school."

The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Answer the following questions:
- Which NYC schools have the best mathematics results?
- What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
- Which single NYC borough has the largest standard deviation?

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/456b9869-cb71-409e-b50a-cb2f27fba081/edit).

### Analyzing Students’ Mental Health

#### Project Description
> "Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? One Japanese international university decided to find out! Use your data manipulation skills to explore the data from a study on mental health of international students and fin out which factors may have the greatest impact."

The project description was taken from the DataCamp project website.

#### Project Tasks
Perform exploratory data analysis on the students data to explore how the length of stay impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of international students. The final table should have the following columns:
- `stay` : length of stay,
- `count_int` : number of international students for each length of stay,
- `average_phq` : average of the PHQ-9 test,
- `average_scs` : average of the SCS test,
- `average_as` : average of the ASISS test.

The completed project can be found in my [DataLab notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/df6f7f7f-fadc-483a-b190-0f41177a495b/edit).
