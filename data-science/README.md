# Christos Kitsios' Portfolio

## Data Science Portfolio

Recently, I subscribed to [**DataCamp**](https://www.datacamp.com/)'s premium plan to practice my Python programming skills with a focus on data science topics and completed the *Data Analyst in Python* career track ([Statement of Accomplishment](https://www.datacamp.com/completed/statement-of-accomplishment/track/4cbf0f07447fcdd69112f2cbf22d4d89c061956b)).

Currently, I am pursuing the *Associate Data Scientist in Python* career track which includes courses on:
- exploratory data analysis, 
- statistical hypothesis testing,
- predictive modeling with machine learning.

This track provides hands-on experience in various Python libraries for data science, including: 
- pandas for data manipulation,
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization,
- scikit-learn for machine learning,
- statsmodels for statistical analysis.

More information on the *Associate Data Scientist in Python* career track can be found in the [track's website](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/associate-data-scientist-in-python).
